# Robustness Exploration of Semantic Information in Adversarial Training

## Introduction
### This is the implementation of the paper ["Semantically Consistent Visual Representation for Adversarial Robustness"]

## Usage
### Installation
The training environment (PyTorch and dependencies) can be installed as follows:
```
cd SCARL-master
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Train SCARL fron scratch on CIFAR-10
```
sh ./train.sh
```
### Evaluate SCARL
```
sh ./eval.sh
```
